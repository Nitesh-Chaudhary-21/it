<hr width=50% align="center" color=#00FFFF>

If the security breach at the Babha Atomic Research Center last year by the hacker group milworm didnâ€™t convince you of their capabilities, then consider this: James Davis aka jdavis_a, a resident of <a href="https://www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/Bit/2483">www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/Bit/2483</a> homestead community on the Internet, might just be reading your e-mail in your mailbox right now, or using your account for some benign Internet surfing, or exchanging it with someone else on the Net for more such accounts!
